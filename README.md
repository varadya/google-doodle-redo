## 
I wanted to redo this Google Doodle because when I turned it in, I couldn't get it to animate anywhere other than CodePen and as we both found out, my file management was terrible. Sorry for that, I'm normally better at those things. In order to get my Google Doodle Redo to animate, I wanted it to appear and a line drawing so I found a helpful video on Treehouse that was able to help me accomplish that animation.
